*by Krissy Gianforte | 14 October 2018*

Imagine your last trip to Target. You entered the store with your shopping list in-hand, intending to buy "just a few things". As you walked down the aisles, though, extra items caught your eye - a cute coffee mug, or a soft throw blanket that would definitely match your living room. And so began the battle of wits - you versus the store. Hopefully you stayed strong and focused, and ended the day with your budget at least *partially* in tact.
Now instead of that coffee mug and blanket, imagine that Target had an aisle designed specifically for you, containing all of the items you've *almost* purchased but decided against. As you walk through the store, you are bombarded by that pair of shoes you always wanted, sitting on a shelf right next to a box set of your favorite movies. How can you resist?
As stores collect more and more personal data on their customers, they are able to create exactly that shopping experience. But is that really a fair strategy?

#### Classic economics
Stores have always used psychological tricks to help you spend more money. Shopping malls [don't have clocks](https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/malls-dont-clocks-tricks-use-get-spend-money.html/) to make sure you are not reminded that you need to leave; fast food restaurants offer "Extra Value Meals" that actually [aren't any less expensive than buying the items individually](https://blogs.findlaw.com/common_law/2018/04/judge-mcdonalds-extra-value-meals-dont-need-to-cost-less-than-individual-items.html), and movie theatres use [price framing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2014/06/18/online-decision-making-what-really-drives-customers-to-choose-one-option-over-another/#6a2d11ce2bc4) to entice you into purchasing the medium size popcorn even though it is more than you want to eat.

All of these tactics are fairly well known - shoppers often even consciously recognize that they are being manipulated. Most don't take offense though. After all, these tactics are generic, designed to trick the "average person". More careful, astute shoppers can surely avoid the traps.

#### An unfair advantage
Enter the digital age.

#### Business as usual?
